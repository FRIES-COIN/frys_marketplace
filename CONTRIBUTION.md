## Tech Stack

- **React (TypeScript)**: Frontend framework
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling
- **ShadcnUI / Aceternity UI / DaisyUI**: UI component libraries for templates
- **Zustand**: State management (planned for future use)

## Branching Strategy

We use the **Gitflow** workflow for branching. Follow the strategy below:

- **main**: This branch contains the production-ready code.
- **develop**: The active development branch where all feature branches should be merged.
- **feature/**: Create feature branches for specific sections (e.g., `feature/navbar`, `feature/hero`, etc.).
- _Remember to always create a branch of the feature you are working on then pulling from develop before beginning_

Naming conventions for feature branches:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/navbar
```

## Tasks and Components

| Component | Assignee |
| --------- | -------- |
| Navbar    | Mary     |
| Hero      | Steve    |
| LiveSale  | Sylus    |
| Footer    | Chriss   |

### Important points before contributing

- Always create a new branch from develop before starting
- Avoid force pushing
- While developing a new feature change as little files as possible(To reduce chances of having conflicts when merging branches)
- Make sure the code runs with no error before submitting a PR to develop

## Pull Requests

- All Pull Requests (PRs) should be submitted to the `develop` branch.
- Ensure the PR title includes the feature or bug fix you're working on. Use a clear and descriptive title such as:
- The body of the PR should include:

1. A brief description of the changes made.
2. Screenshots, if applicable, to illustrate UI changes.
3. Any issues that the PR closes or addresses (use GitHub issue numbers).
4. Testing instructions (how to run the component and verify its functionality).

- Before submitting the PR:

1. Ensure that the code follows the coding standards (see below).
2. Run linting and formatting checks using `eslint` and `prettier` if configured.
3. Ensure the component is responsive and tested across multiple screen sizes.
4. Ensure no errors or warnings in the console for the specific component.

- At least one code reviewer must approve the PR before it is merged into the `develop` branch.

- After a successful review and approval, the PR will be merged.

## Coding Standards

We are using **React with TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**. Please follow the coding standards below:

### 1. **React (TypeScript) Guidelines**

- Use **TypeScript** for all React components to ensure type safety.
- Define prop types explicitly using TypeScript `interface` or `type` declarations.
- Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.

Example:

```ts
interface NavbarProps {
  user: string;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}

const Navbar: React.FC<NavbarProps> = ({ user, isAuthenticated }) => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <p>Welcome, {user}</p>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

### 2. Use functional components with hooks (no class components)

Example:

```ts
const Hero: React.FC = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch some data
  }, []);

  return <div>{data ? data : "Loading..."}</div>;
};
```

### 3. Always destructure props in functional components

Example:

```ts
const Footer: React.FC<{ year: number }> = ({ year }) => (
  <footer>{year}</footer>
);
```

### 4. TailwindCSS Guidelines

- Use TailwindCSS utility-first classes for styling. Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.

  Example:

```tsx
return (
  <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">Click Me</button>
);
```

- Responsive design:

Utilize Tailwind's responsive utilities to ensure components adapt to different screen sizes.

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {/* Your content */}
</div>
```

### 5. General code quality

- Prettier: Ensure your code is formatted consistently. Use Prettier for automatic formatting.

- ESLint: Run lint checks to ensure your code follows proper React and TypeScript patterns.

- Folder structure: Keep components organized in respective folders under /components, /pages, or /utils.

- Naming conventions: Use camelCase for function names, and PascalCase for component names.

Example:

```tsx
// Good naming
const MyComponent = () => { ... };

// Avoid bad naming
const my_component = () => { ... };
```
